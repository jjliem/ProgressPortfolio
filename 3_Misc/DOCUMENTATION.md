# DOCUMENTATION

---

## Why I write documentation

For mysef:

- makes it easier when I look back at my code 6 months later
- helps me understand requirements, changes, and flow even as I'm actively working on the project 
- promotes ownership and accountability of code

For others:

- installation steps help get team up to speed faster
- reduces time spent on struggling to find resources and doing repetitive Knowledge Transfer sessions
- allows reproducability and transparency

## How I write documentation

Google Doc:
- Summary/Description
- Installation instructions (relevant repos, how to set up locally)
- Low level diagrams
- Questions
- TODO log
- Development log (errors raised along the way and attempts at fixes)

In The Code:
- Function descriptions (what it does, where to use it, etc)
- Explanations for any relevant discrepancies/exceptions
- Include link to documentation doc
- Outline code sections clearly
